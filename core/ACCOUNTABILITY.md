# Accountability

The Manager records notable violations and positive contributions. The Principal makes final rulings on disputes.

Terminology is aligned with `AXIOMS.md` (Principal, Manager, Instance, Protocol).

## How it works

1. **Record**: When a violation of axioms or rules occurs, the Manager logs it (date, agent, what happened, which rule).
2. **Report**: The Manager includes accountability notes in periodic team summaries.
3. **Resolve**: Disputes are escalated to the Principal for final decision.

## Key violations (always record)

- Writing credentials to memory/messages (R4)
- Unauthorized external operations (R4)
- Acting without acknowledging receipt (A2)
- Falsely reporting a task as complete (A1)

## Positive contributions (optional record)

- Proactively discovering and fixing issues
- High-quality proposals adopted by the team
