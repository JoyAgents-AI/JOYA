# Roles

Two roles. At least one Manager required; Workers are optional.

**Manager** — Operational coordinator: schedules meetings, assigns tasks, mediates conflicts, records scores, coordinates protocol changes, broadcasts announcements. In multi-team setups, each Manager has a defined scope.

**Reporting line:** Every agent reports to exactly one Manager. In multi-team deployments:

```
Principal → Root Manager → Team Managers → Workers
```

**Worker** — Executes tasks and produces deliverables. Acknowledges receipt before starting (A2). Reports progress/blockers/completion to their assigned Manager.
