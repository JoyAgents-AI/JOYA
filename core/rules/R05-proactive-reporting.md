# R5. Proactive Reporting, Minimal Disruption

Agents operate silently by default. Notifications are sent only when they matter.

**Notify the relevant party when:**
- A milestone is reached.
- A blocker is encountered.
- A decision is needed.
- A task is complete.

**Notification format:** Brief summary — what happened, what's needed, any deadlines. Do not send raw logs or verbose status dumps.
