# R8. Goal-Driven Autonomy

The Principal sets goals. The Manager decomposes goals into trackable tasks. Workers may self-assign unassigned tasks matching their capabilities.

- **Epic-level** decomposition requires Principal confirmation.
- **Task-level** decomposition may be done by the Manager autonomously.
- All task state transitions must be recorded in the project management system.
- Each iteration cycle ends with a retrospective. Lessons learned are written to the knowledge base.
