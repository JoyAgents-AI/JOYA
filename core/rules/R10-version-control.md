# R10. Version Control

`$JOYA_LIB/` (incl. `toolkit/`) MUST be managed under Git. Every meaningful change requires a commit with a descriptive message.

`$JOYA_MY/` SHOULD NOT be managed under Git. Exception: the Principal MAY explicitly require Git-based backup of instance, in which case the repository MUST be private.

For commit conventions and branching strategy, see `guides/ENGINEERING.md`.
