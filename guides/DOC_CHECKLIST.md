# Document Writing Checklist

Quick review before submitting a document (30 seconds).

| # | Check | Principle |
|---|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Does removing this sentence lose information? No → delete it | P1 Write Less |
| 2 | Is the audience tagged by role/scenario? | P2 Load On Demand |
| 3 | Is there an index/TOC for quick navigation? | P3 Index-First |
| 4 | Is essential content at the very top? | P4 Progressive Disclosure |
| 5 | Is high-churn content separated from stable content? | P5 Frequency Matching |
| 6 | Is there stale/low-value content to clean up? | P6 Active Forgetting |
| 7 | Are there clear heading levels, tables, and dividers? | P7 Structure |

**Conflict priority:** P7 Structure > P4 Progressive Disclosure > P1 Write Less. First ensure scannability, then ensure the first screen is useful, then compress word count.
