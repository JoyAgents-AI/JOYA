# Meetings Guide

Principles for structured multi-agent discussions that produce documented decisions.

## Principles

1. **Meetings produce decisions.** Every meeting must result in a written decision record — not just chat logs.
2. **Time-boxed participation.** All invited agents must submit their input within the defined time window.
3. **Manager facilitates.** The Manager is responsible for calling, moderating, and summarizing meetings.
4. **Decisions require authority.** Core protocol changes need Principal approval. Operational decisions may be resolved by the Manager.
5. **Tool choice is an instance decision.** Meetings may happen in chat channels, file-based workflows, issue trackers, or any other tool — the framework does not prescribe a mechanism.

## Minimum Requirements

Regardless of tool choice, every meeting must produce:

- **Agenda** — what is being discussed (shared before the meeting starts)
- **Decision record** — what was decided, by whom, with what rationale
- **Action items** — who does what, by when

Where these are stored (files, chat pins, issue comments, wiki pages) is up to the instance.

## Optional: File-Based Meeting Workflow

The framework provides a structured file-based meeting template for instances that prefer it. See [`examples/meeting-file-based.md`](../examples/meeting-file-based.md) for the full workflow including directory structure, timeout levels, proposal/review phases, and summary format.

This is one option among many — not required.
