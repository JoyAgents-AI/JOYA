# Agents — Joy Agents Governed

This workspace is governed by the Joy Agents protocol.

## On every session start (and after compaction)

Read `../../joya/lib/AGENT_INIT.md` and follow its instructions.

> **Note:** If your platform (e.g., OpenClaw) already injects MEMORY.md as workspace context, do NOT re-read it in the loading chain. Check if you can see your MEMORY.md content without a file read — if yes, it's already injected.
